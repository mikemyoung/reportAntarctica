Title: The Automated Aggregation of Scopus Publications
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mike Meredyth-Young
Maintainer: Mike Meredyth-Young <mike.meredythyoung@vuw.ac.nz>
Description: This package pulls together publications and their associated metadata from Scopus. It is designed to enable users to specify a Scopus search query which is then used to aggregate and curate the associated records. This package utilises a high level wrapper function which enables users with minimal R experience to aggregate recrods for their own bibliometric analyses within the R environment. Further, it provides a function that enables users to create a relational database of the results for more granular analyses of authors and their affiliations.
